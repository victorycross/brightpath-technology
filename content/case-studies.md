## Case Study 1: Retail Inventory Optimization

### Client Profile
A mid-sized Canadian retail chain with 35 locations across Ontario and Quebec, struggling with inventory management and stock forecasting.

### Challenge
The client was experiencing significant challenges with inventory management, including:
- Frequent stockouts of popular items, leading to lost sales
- Excess inventory of slow-moving products, tying up capital
- Manual forecasting processes that were time-consuming and error-prone
