title: About Us
company_story: >
  BrightPath Technology was founded in 2022 by a team of AI specialists and business strategists who recognized the gap between advanced AI technologies and practical business applications. Our founders saw that many Canadian businesses were struggling to leverage the power of artificial intelligence due to technical complexity, implementation challenges, and unclear ROI.


  With a mission to make AI accessible and valuable for businesses of all sizes, we've grown from a small consultancy to a comprehensive AI solutions provider serving clients across retail, financial services, manufacturing, healthcare, and more. Our journey has been guided by a commitment to excellence, innovation, and measurable results.
